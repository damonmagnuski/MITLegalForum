We plan on uploading a series of letters that are optimized over time to allow an individual / family to delete their data from assorted data brokers and other corporates.

Adding "Broker Letter Version 2"
This letter was sent 12-6-17 to 22 data brokers.  16 letters were sent as some brokers share compliance services.  When the responses come in, we will tabulate the results and post.  Based on results, we will start to optimize letters on per broker basis.

We added three experimental features to this letter.  We asked for a copy of the data, we asked the broker to identify their sources of data, and provide a list of affiliates to whom the deletion letter applies.
